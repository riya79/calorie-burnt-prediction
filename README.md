# calorie-burnt-prediction
The project is designed with the goal of advancing our understanding and prediction of calorie burn to enhance health and fitness outcomes. In a world where personalized health strategies are gaining prominence, predicting calorie burn plays a pivotal role in guiding individuals towards optimal diet, exercise, and overall well-being. 

## Key Features
Age: The age of individuals involved in the study.
BMI (Body Mass Index): A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
Duration: The time spent on physical activities, a critical factor in calorie expenditure.
Heart Rate: Monitoring heart rate provides insights into the intensity of activities.
Body Temperature: The physiological factor impacting calorie burn during activities.

# Working
1.Calorie burn prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) involves a multistep process. 
2.Initially, a comprehensive dataset is collected, including factors like age, weight, height, activity level, and exercise duration. This dataset is then preprocessed, normalizing values and splitting it into training and testing sets. 
3.The ANN's architecture is designed with input layers corresponding to the features, hidden layers for complexity, and an output layer predicting calorie burn. Through training, the model adjusts its weights and biases using optimization algorithms, aiming to minimize prediction errors.
4. Evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error or Mean Absolute Error assess the model's performance with a separate testing dataset. 
5. Fine-tuning, or hyperparameter tuning, optimizes factors such as learning rate and batch size. Once trained, the ANN can predict calorie burn for new input data, making it ready for deployment in real-time applications. Regular updates with new data ensure continuous improvement in accuracy over time.
